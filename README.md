## Sample

```cs
using Godot;
using Nebula;

namespace MyGame
{
	public partial class PlayableCharacter : NetworkNode3D
	{
		[NetworkProperty]
		public int Money { get; set; }

		public OnNetworkChangeMoney(int _tick, int oldVal, int newVal)
		{
			// This is only called on the client-side
			GD.Print("I have " + newVal + " money now! Thanks, server.");
		}

		public override void _NetworkProcess(int _tick)
		{
			base._NetworkProcess(_tick);
			if (NetworkRunner.Instance.IsServer)
			{
				// This is only called on the server-side
				Money += 1;
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## Features

* Tick-aligned system
* Single state authority (Dedicated-server model)
* Input authority (cheat prevention)
* Data Interpolation
* Advanced, variable-level Interest management
* Multiple "Worlds" within one Godot server instance

### Coming soon
* Rollback / Lag compensation (blocked by [Godot #2821](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/2821))

## Getting started

### Pre-setup notes

* Requires Godot.NET (this is a C# library)

### Setup steps

1. Add Nebula to your "addons"
2. Import Nebula in your `.csproj`. For example:
```xml
<Project Sdk="Godot.NET.Sdk/4.3.0-beta.1">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <Import Project="addons\Nebula\Nebula.props" />
</Project>
```
3. Enable the Nebula plugin in Godot

#### Help

## Documentation

## What is this?

Nebula is a library for developing online multiplayer games with Godot. It is a tick-aligned system, respects input authority, and all state is managed by the server.

This library is still in BETA, therefore it is not quite production-ready and is subject to changes as we approach stability.
